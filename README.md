# Text-generation-using-an-RNN

## Overview
This project implements a text generation model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The model is structured to follow industry standards, employing a class-based design for better modularity and reusability.

## Features
- Text generation based on input sequences.
- Configurable model parameters (embedding size, RNN units).
- Trainable model with custom datasets.
