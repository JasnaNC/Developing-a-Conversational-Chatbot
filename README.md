# Developing a Conversational Chatbot

This project implements a simple chatbot using the `transformers` library from Hugging Face. The chatbot leverages a pre-trained model to generate conversational responses based on user input.

## Overview

The `Chatbot` class is designed to provide a conversational agent that can interact with users in a natural language format. It uses the `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The chatbot maintains a history of the conversation to generate contextually relevant responses.

### Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence language model.
- **Conversation History**: Maintains a history of the conversation to provide context-aware responses.
- **Interactive Chat**: Provides an interactive chat interface for user interaction.
